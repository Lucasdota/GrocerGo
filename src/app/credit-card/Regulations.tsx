              To access all the benefits of GrocerGo stores and the GrocerGo
              cards, such as discounts, installment plans, and a points program,
              you will be enrolled, at no additional cost, within 30 (thirty)
              days of credit card activation in the &quot;Customer Plus&quot;

              enjoy the Customer Plus benefits by downloading the GrocerGo app
              from your mobile app store, filling out the registration, and
              enjoying these benefits. Just don&apos;t forget to always activate
              the discounts.

              GrocerGo and Customer Plus bring work, as failure to comply with
              the rules for granting benefits does not guarantee the advantages
              that are available to you.
